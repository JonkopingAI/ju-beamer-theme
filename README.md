# Jönköping University Beamer Theme

A [LaTeX Beamer](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) theme with elements from [Jönköping University](https://ju.se/) branding.

## About this theme

This Beamer theme is based on the popular [Metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), with some customizations and additions made by myself or derived from other themes, e.g. [colorful-dream](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/beamer-themes).
All the usual customizations provided by the Metropolis theme should work; if you're not familiar with it, check out the [documentation of Metropolis](https://ftpmirror1.infania.net/mirror/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/beamer-contrib/themes/metropolis/doc/metropolistheme.pdf) for detailed information.

:warning: **This theme is _not_ officially endorsed by Jönköping University.** It makes **no guarantees** to fully adhere to JU's graphic manual. (In fact, it most likely doesn't.)

## Quickstart

1. Copy the `latexmkrc` as well as the `sty/` directory into your project.

2. Download the desired [**logotypes** from the JU intranet](https://intranet.hj.se/intranet/en/service-and-support/marketing-and-communication/graphic-profile/logotypes.html) *(requires a JU account)* and extract the **PNG** files into `sty/img/`.

3. Select the theme in your Beamer presentation via `\usetheme{metropolis-ju}`.

4. **Compile with LuaLaTeX** (or XeLaTeX) for proper font support etc.!

:information_source: For more information about customization options, new commands, features, etc., check out the example presentation in this repo!  This also goes for font options: by default, the theme uses _Source Sans Pro_ fonts, but different settings are available.

:notebook: If you [write to me](mailto:marcel.bollmann@ju.se) from a `@ju.se` e-mail address, I can also share a link to an **Overleaf template** you can copy with the logotypes (from step 2) already included.
